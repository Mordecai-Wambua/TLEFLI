# TLEFLI App

## Project Overview

The goal of the TLEFLI app and web platform is to help users report lost items or register found items with ease. A sophisticated algorithm will match lost items with found ones, notify relevant users, and facilitate item returns through verification and secure methods.

## Core Functionalities

- User Registration & Authentication
  - Users can register or sign in using email, phone number, or social media (Google, Facebook, etc.).
  - Option to set up profiles with personal details like name, contact information, and location.
- Reporting Lost Items
  - Form to enter key details:
    - Item Name
    - Category (e.g., electronics, clothing, pets, etc.)
    - Description (detailed information, unique characteristics)
    - City or Location (where the item was lost)
    - Date (when the item was lost)
    - Optional photo upload (to help match visually)
  - Submission will be processed by the system, and a search will be conducted automatically for any matches in the database.
- Reporting Found Items
  - Form to enter key details:
    - Item Name
    - Category
    - Description (unique details to verify ownership)
    - City or Location (where the item was found)
    - Date
    - Optional photo upload
  - Submitted information will be indexed to enable matching with lost reports.
- Matching Algorithm
  - A back-end algorithm automatically compares lost and found reports based on several factors:
    - Similarity of item descriptions
    - Location match
    - Time proximity
    - Visual comparison of photos (optional AI integration for image recognition)
- Notification & Alerts
  - Automatic notifications are sent to both parties (the finder and the loser) when a potential match is found.
  - Push notifications, SMS, or email can be used to notify users instantly.
- Verification Process
  - To ensure the rightful owner, a security question will be asked:
    - Example: “Describe the scratch on the coat or what’s in the right pocket.”
  - Users must provide correct responses to proceed with claiming the item.
  - After verification, the user can arrange for pickup or delivery.
- Pickup or Delivery Option
  - For matched items:
    - Users can arrange to pick up the item from the finder or the organization (e.g., a restaurant).
    - Option to have the item delivered by a courier or through the app's partner network (next-day delivery option).
- Admin Dashboard (for Organizations)
  - Businesses (like restaurants, hotels, or offices) can log in to manage lost and found items.
  - View found items and update status when they are claimed.
  - Set up item pickup or delivery logistics for users.
  - Access analytics to see lost item reports, return success rates, and cost savings.

## Additional Features

- Geolocation Tracking
  - Users can input locations or enable GPS to pinpoint where items were lost or found.
  - The system will suggest nearby items based on the entered location.
- Data Security & Privacy
  - Strong encryption for personal data (GDPR compliance for European users).
  - Security protocols to protect user information and prevent false claims or scams.
- Multilingual Support
  - The app should support multiple languages, starting with English, French, and Arabic (with the ability to add more languages later).
- Feedback System
  - After an item is claimed or returned, users can leave feedback on the platform, rating the process, communication, and app experience.

## Platform Requirements

- Mobile App (iOS & Android)
  - Native or cross-platform (React Native or Flutter).
  - Must support common device screen sizes.
  - Smooth user interface with easy navigation and fast load times.
  - Push notifications for alerts.
- Web-Based Platform (PC Version)
  - Responsive design for both desktop and tablet screens.
  - User-friendly dashboard for submitting reports and managing lost and found items.
  - Admin panel for companies with bulk item uploads (CSV format or manual).
- Cloud Backend and Database
  - Cloud-based system to handle large volumes of data.
  - Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL options like Firebase.
  - Server-side code using frameworks like Node.js or Django.
- Image Recognition (Optional)
  - Integrate AI-driven image recognition for better matching accuracy.
  - Tools like Google Vision API, AWS Rekognition, or OpenCV for analyzing photos.

## Tech Stack Suggestions

- Frontend (Mobile & Web)
  - React Native or Flutter for mobile apps (cross-platform).
  - React.js, Vue.js, or Angular for the web interface.
- Backend
  - Node.js with Express or Django for the server-side logic.
  - Integration with cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
- Database
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Firebase for managing user data and lost/found item information.
